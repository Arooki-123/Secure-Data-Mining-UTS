# Secure Data Mining (UTS IDA Assignment 3)

This repo contains my secure data preprocessing and modeling workflow for predicting subscription to term deposits. Although originally a marketing task, many methods used here are applicable to cybersecurity: safe data handling, reducing false positives, and sensitivity to risk.

## Skills Demonstrated:
- Secure data cleaning (ambiguous placeholder handling)
- Label + one-hot encoding for feature integrity
- Z-score normalization to prevent model bias
- Classifier comparison with recall/ROC focus (like in IDS)
- Final model: Neural Network (MLP) for balanced prediction
